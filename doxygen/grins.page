\section overview Overview

The GRINS code has been developed to serve as a test bed for 
numerical methods, based on finite elements, for multiphysics problems
involving various forms of incompressible flow.
It is written in object-oriented C++ and leverages heavily the 
C++ finite element library 
<a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a>. Although the majority of GRINS is
contained in a library, example applications
are included as well, including a generic solver.

Thanks for your interest in GRINS. To aid in usage, this manual is
further divided into the following subsections:

reported to pbauman@ices.utexas.edu.  Requests and contributions are
welcome at the same e-mail address.  All bug reports should include:
<ul>

/*! \page inputFile Example GRINS Input File

This is an example input file for use with the generic solver
included with GRINS.
Note that GRINS is using 
the <a href="http://getpot.sourceforge.net/">GetPot</a> parsing tool
shipped with <a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a>.  Note
that the default comment delimiter is defined as the \# sign and
comments can begin at the beginning of a line or after a variable
declaration to aid in documenting the input file.  The parsing
mechansism is keyword driven and can be organized into multiple
sections.  Consequently, you are allowed to have variables of the same
name so long as they are within unique section definitions.  Note also
that because the parsing mechanism is keyword driven, the input
directives can be specified in \e arbitrary order.  There is no
requirement to maintain a specific variable declaration pattern.

/*! \page installation Installation/Linkage

GRINS uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool)
for its development build system.  This system is popular among the
Linux development community and provides a familiar build environment
for end users.  

To build GRINS starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 > tar xvfz grins-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd grins-$(VERSION)/            
</pre></div>

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

GRINS requires that the <a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a>
be available locally, along with the <a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a>
dependencies. Note that GRINS has been developed and tested on revision 4887 of 
trunk. If <a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a> is installed and available
within your default login environment, then GRINS should automatically configure
against the available installation.  If, however, your <a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a>
installation is in a non-standard location, use
the <tt>--with-libmesh</tt> option to specify the location.

To date, GRINS has been successfully built and tested with the gcc 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 compilers
and the Intel 11.1 compilers.

<b>Installation Directory</b>: Use the <tt>--prefix</tt> option to
specify your desired top-level installation directory for GRINS.  The
examples below all configure GRINS to be installed in the user's ~/bin/grins
directory.

<em>Configure with libMesh from default login environment:</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grins \endcode

<em>Or, configure with libMesh from a specific directory:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grins --with-libmesh=$MY_LIBMESH_DIR \endcode

<em>Or, configure with specific compilers:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure CXX=g++ --prefix=$HOME/bin/grins \endcode

<h2> Other Configuration Options </h2>

GRINS can optionally be built with other libraries as well. In particular, GRINS leverages the 
<a href="https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/GRVY">GRVY</a> library for
some performance timing capabilities. 

<em>Configure with libGRVY and enable grvy timers :</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --with-grvy=$MY_GRVY_DIR --enable-grvy-timers \endcode

To enable verification using the method of manufactured solutions, GRINS uses
the <a href="https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/MASA">MASA</a> 
library. Although GRINS can configure and build with 
<a href="https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/MASA">MASA</a>, it is currently not
using these capabilities. This is planned for the next release.

<em>Configure with MASA:</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --with-masa=$MY_MASA_DIR \endcode

Configure help can also be accessed at the command line:

\code> ./configure --help \endcode

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful, this
will build GRINS (static and dynamic libraries and executables).

\code > make \endcode

If you have multiple cores at your disposal, a parallel buid can accelerate
the build time. If there are 4 cores avaiable, then the following will build
using 4 threads, thereby leveraging 4 processors.

\code > make -j 4\endcode

<b> Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working
properly, a test option is provided to run a short suite of
functionality tests against the local build.  To run, issue a <tt>make
check</tt> to run the tests. Note that these tests may take a few minutes
depending upon optimization level and architecture.  
If successfull, output similar to the
following will be generated.

\code
 > make check

\endcode

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue a <tt>make install</tt> to install
GRINS. This will install the header files, libraries, executables,
and examples.  
The installation will consist of four top-level
directories housing the library, include files, executables, and
example files.  An example of the top-level directories after
installation is shown below:

\code > make install \endcode

Top-level GRINS installation directory:

\code
 > ls $HOME/bin/grins/
 bin  examples  include  lib
\endcode

<h2>Library Linkage</h2>

Although a generic solver is shipped with the code, you may wish to
write your own application code. To link an external application with the library, the
\c include directory must be added to the compilers include search
path in order to access the necessary header files.  The \c lib directory should also be added
to the linker search path along with a request to link against the
GRINS library.  Several example link steps are provided below.  These
examples assume that the GRINS library has been successfully built and
installed previously in the users's ~/bin/grins directory:

\code > $(CXX) -I$HOME/bin/grins/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grins/lib -lgrins \endcode

To embed the dynamic library search path for the GRINS library
directly into the application executable, use an additional linker
option as follows:

\code > $(CXX) -I$HOME/bin/grins/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grins/lib \
         -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/bin/grins/lib -lgrins \endcode
