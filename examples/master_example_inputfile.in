# This master example input file is for reference on specifying
# various input parameters to GRINS. The GetPot parsing library
# is used to parse the input files. Documentation about GetPot
# can be found here:
# http://getpot.sourceforge.net/documentation-index.html
# The Doxygen documentation can be found here:
# http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/classGETPOT__NAMESPACE_1_1GetPot.html
#
# Concrete examples of usage can be found in both the examples
# directories and in test/input_files (which are the input_files for
# the tests in the testing suite).
#
# We heavily use GetPots sectioning system, particularly nested
# sections. Discussion of this can be found here:
# http://getpot.sourceforge.net/node13.html
# Below we give examples of different uses for the various sections
# GRINS uses. Note that the section names must be unique. We provide
# multiple example usages of the sections below, but you must only use
# one. E.g. we illustrate the different uses of [Mesh] below, but
# there must only be one instance of the [Mesh] section in the input
# file used.
#
# GRINS uses GetPot's UFO capability so that if there are variables in the
# input file that are unused during your program, GRINS will throw
# an error. This is to reduce the chance of errors in the input
# file specification.
#
# In the default grins binary, as well as in any libgrins.so
# application that so chooses, it is possible to override input-file
# options using command-line options.  For example, running
# $ grins input.in Mesh/class=parallel
# will try to use a DistributedMesh regardless of what the value of
# Mesh/class is in input.in
#
# The primary sections are:
#    [Mesh] - all options related to the mesh used in the simulation
#    [Materials] - all material property specifications
#    [Strategies] - options related to things like adaptive time
#                   stepping and AMR
#    [SolverOptions] - all options related to the (non)linear solver,
#                      time stepping, etc.
#    [BoundaryConditions] - Boundary condition specification
#    [Variables] - Variable and finite element space specification

# The block below illustrates the use of the variables
# block. The variables are one of the most central concepts
# in the input file. The boundary conditions, initial conditions,
# and Physics will all reference the Variables section to varying
# degrees. There are two schema for Variable naming: the first is
# that the user can arbitrarily set the variable names, but then
# must set the "type"; the second is simply making the variable name
# one of the understood types and then the type specification is
# not needed.
#
# The type is used internally for things like axisymmetric boundary conditions.
# For each of the variables, the arguments "names" and "order" are
# always required. Additionally, "fe_family" is required for
# non-SCALAR variables.
#
# Variables also support restriction to subdomains. The user can
# set enabled_subdomains = '1 2 3' where 1 2 3 are the subdomain ids
# to which the variables will be restricted. If the enabled_subdomains argument
# is not present, it is assumed the variable is active on all
# subdomains. Note that any Physics that uses a subdomain restricted
# variable must be active on an inclusive subset of the subdomains
