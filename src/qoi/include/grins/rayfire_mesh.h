  /*!
    This class performs a rayfire across a given mesh.
    The user supplies an origin point on the mesh boundary,
    and spherical angle(s) theta (and phi for 3D) to describe the direction of the rayfire.
    As is standard in spherical coordinates, theta is the angle from the x-axis in the xy-plane,
    with counterclockwise being positive. -2&pi; &le; theta &le; +2&pi;.
    Phi is the angle from the xy-plane, with phi>0 being in the positive half of the z-plane.
    -&pi; &le; phi &le; +&pi;

    Starting at the given origin point, this class will walk in a straight line
    across the mesh in the prescribed direction. On each element along the line,
    the class will calculate the point where it enters and leaves that element.
    Knowing the entering and exiting points, an EDGE2 element
    is created with those points as nodes, and is added to an internal 1D mesh.
    This repeats until a main mesh boundary is reached.

    The intent of this class is to use the 1D mesh to integrate quantities along the
    rayfire path. Using the map_to_rayfire_elem() function, a separate integration class
    can access the 1D elements, prescribe a desired quadrature rule, and perform
    integration directly along the line, rather than using the entire 2D/3D elements
    of the main mesh.

    Refinement and coarsening of the rayfire mesh are supported through the reinit() function.

      The rayfire line can be represented in point-slope form:

      y-y0 = m(x-x0)

      where m is the slope and (x0,y0) is the known initial_point. To find the intersection point,
      we will use a parametric representation of the edge utilizing the shape functions as such:

      X(&xi;) = sum( x<SUB>j</SUB> &phi;<SUB>j</SUB>(&xi;) )

      Y(&xi;) = sum( y<SUB>j</SUB> &phi;<SUB>j</SUB>(&xi;) )

      where x<SUB>j</SUB> and y<SUB>j</SUB> are the node x- and y-coordinates, respectively,
      and &phi;<SUB>j</SUB> is the value of shape function j at reference coordinate &xi;

      The intersection point is then where the x and y coordinates from the point-slope equation
      equal the X and Y coordinates from the parametric equations for the given edge, respectively.
      We can then form a residual by substituting the parametric coordinates into the point slope
      form and bringing all terms to one side of the equation as:

      f = 0 = m(X(&xi;)-x0) - (Y(&xi;)-y0)

      The residual is then a function of a single parameter, namely the reference coordinate &xi;.
      The derivative is rather trivial and can be expressed as

      df = m*dX - dY

      where

      dX = sum( x<SUB>j</SUB> d&phi;<SUB>j</SUB>/d&xi; )

      dY = sum( y<SUB>j</SUB> d&phi;<SUB>j</SUB>/d&xi; )
